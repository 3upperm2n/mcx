          1. [2]Command Line Options

          2. [3]Input File Format

1. Command Line Options

Required option

-f / --input

   Format
          A string

   Default value
          None, user must specify

   Restriction
          parameter can not be longer than 1024 characters (including the
          string ending mark '\0' )

   Description

   Use -f to specify an input file. Format:
    -f filename.json

   or
    -f filename.inp

   filename may contain absolute or relative path. If the filename has a
   '.json' extension, this input file is in the JSON format. If the input
   file name ends with '.inp', it is in the legacy format. If the file
   name contains space, one must use quotation marks to quote the full
   file name. In Windows, the quotation must be double quote (""). In
   Linux or Mac, either single or double quotation mark works.

   If this flag is followed by an inline JSON string, such as -f '{...}',
   the parameter is parsed as an "inline JSON input file".

MC options

-n / --photon

   Format
          An integer or floating point number

   Default value
          0

   Restriction
          the number can not exceed 2^32-1

   Description

   This flag specifies the total number of photons to be simulated. The
   format is

    -n N

   where N can be either an integer, such as 100000 or a floating point
   number, such as 1e5. If N is a floating point number, it will be
   rounded to the largest integer below the current value. If this number
   is larger than 1e9, we suggest one to use the [4]"-r" option followed
   by an integer larger than 1.

-r / --repeat

   Format
          An integer

   Default value
          1

   Max Value
          the number can not exceed 2^32-1

   Description

   Use -r to evenly divide the total photons into smaller groups so that
   the execution time of each group becomes managable. Format:

    -r N

   where N is a positive integer. When use this option, mcx runs 'total
   photon number/N' photons in a batch.

   This option is useful when one does not have access to a dedicated GPU,
   i.e. the GPU is used for both display and computation. In such case,
   the mcx computation time is limited to only 5 to 10 seconds due to the
   graphics driver. One can use the -r option to make the execution time
   per batch under the time limit set by the driver.

-b / --reflect

   Format
          A boolean, 0 or 1

   Default value
          1

   Restriction
          must be 0 or 1

   Description

   Use -b to enable or disable reflections at the boundaries. Format:

    '-b' or '-b 1' to enable (default) or '-b 0' to disable

   When enabled, mcx will either reflect or transmit the photon at the
   boundaries based on the Fresnel's equation.

   By default, mcx considers refractive index mismatch at the boundaries.

-B / --reflectin

   Format
          A boolean, 0 or 1

   Default value
          1

   Restriction
          must be 0 or 1

   Description

   1 to reflect photons at int. boundary; 0 do not

-u / --unitinmm

   Format
          a floating point number

   Default value
          1.0

   Restriction
          can not be less than or equal to 0

   Description

   Use -u to set the voxel size in mm. Format:

    -u S

   where S is a floating point number, denoting the edge length, in mm, of
   a voxel in the volume. For example, if the volume used in the
   simulation is 0.1x0.1x0.1 mm^3, then, one should use '-u 0.1' in the
   command line.

   Only isotrpic voxels are currently supported by mcx.

-U / --normalize

   Format
          A boolean, 0 or 1

   Default value
          1

   Restriction
          must be 0 or 1

   Description

   Use -U to enable or disable solution normalization. Format:

    '-U' or '-U 1' to enable (default) or '-U 0' to disable

   For fluence, the normalization aims to generate a 'Green's function'.
   For other qualities, the normalization produces a stable solution by
   removing the dependency due to total photon numbers, voxel sizes, and
   time-gate settings. The detailed equations are explained in the MCX
   paper.

-E / --seed

   Format
          An integer or a string

   Default value
          -1

   Restriction
          must be an integer; if is a string, the specified file must
          exist

   Description

   Use -E to set the seed of the CPU random number generator (RNG). The
   CPU RNG in turn initializes the seeds for each GPU thread. Format:

    -E -1    // let MCX to automatically seed the CPU-RNG using system clock
    -E n     // n is a large positive integer, set the CPU-RNG's seed to n
    -E filename.mch // replay detected photons using the seeds saved in the mch file

   Setting a fixed RNG seed is expected to create reproducible results on
   NVIDIA cards if the thread/block size are kept the same.

-z / --srcfrom0

   Format
          A boolean, 0 or 1

   Default value
          0

   Restriction
          must be 0 or 1

   Description

   Use -z to define the coordinate origin mode of the volume. Format:

    -z 0 (default)// assumes the lower-bottom corner of the first voxel as [1 1 1]
    -z or -z 1    // assumes the lower-bottom corner of the first voxel as [0 0 0]

   All source and detector positions are referenced from the origin,
   determined by this flag.

-R / --skipradius

   Format
          An integer

   Default value
          -2

   Restriction
          must be 0 or 1

   Description

   Use -R to specify the scope within which to use atomic operations. The
   possible options include

     -R -2  // this enables full atomic opertions in the entire volume (default)
     -R n   // when n is a positive integer, mcx uses atomic operations in the
            // shared memory for a n x n x n sub-cubic domain centered at the source.
     -R 0   // disable all atomic operations, data racing may exist, particularly
            // near the source.
     -R -1  //use crop0/crop1 to determine atomic zone

   Using full atomic operations was very slow in very early CUDA devices,
   but for most later NVIDIA GPUs, the use of atomic operations is as
   efficient as the non-atomic version.

-k / --voidtime

   Format
          A boolean, 0 or 1

   Default value
          0

   Restriction
          must be 0 or 1

   Description

   Use the -k option to tell MCX whether to count the time-of-flight when
   a photon is launched outside of the volume. Format:

    -k 1 (default)  // the time-of-flight of the photon starts at the launch time
    -k 0            // the time-of-flight starts when a photon enters the first non-zero voxel.

-Y / --replaydet

   Format
          A positive integer

   Default value
          0

   Restriction
          can not be negative

   Description

   Use the -Y option to specify the ID of the detector for the 'replay'
   calculations. Format:

    -Y n   // n is a positive integer, denoting the index of the detectors to be replayed
    -Y 0   // all detected photons will be replayed regardless of detector

   If -Y is not specified, MCX replays all detected photons; otherwise,
   MCX only replays the detected photons from the specified detector. See
   -E for more details.

-P / --shapes

   Format
          A string

   Default value
          None, user must specify

   Restriction
          parameter can not be longer than 1024 characters (including the
          string ending mark '\0' )

   Description

   Use the -P option to dynamically define heterogeneities from the
   command line. The -P flag is followed by a JSON-formatted string. For
   example

    -P '{"Shapes":[{"ZLayers":[[1,10,1],[11,30,2],[31,60,3]]}]}'

   This defines a 3-layer medium: z slices 1-10 is filled with tissue
   label 1, z slices 11-30 is filled with label 2, and 31-60 is filled
   with label 3.

   The shape definition always starts an array object named 'Shapes'. Each
   element in the 'Shapes' object defines a primitive object. The
   supported primitives include
   Name/Origin/Grid/Sphere/Box/Subgrid/{XYZ}Layers/{XYZ}Slabs/Cylinder/Upp
   erSpace. Most objects have a sub-field 'Tag', specifying the tissue
   label (index to the property list). The details of the Shapes objects
   can be found in this link

-N / --reseed (*depreciated)

   Format
          An integer

   Default value
          0

   Restriction
          can not be negative

   Description

   number of scattering events before reseeding RNG

-F / --faststep (*depreciated)

   Format
          A boolean, 0 or 1

   Default value
          0

   Restriction
          must be 0 or 1

   Description

   1-use fast 1mm stepping, [0]-precise ray-tracing

-e / --minenergy

   Format
          A floating point number

   Default value
          0

   Restriction
          must be positive or 0.0

   Description

   Use -e to set the min photon packet weight to trigger Russian Roulette.
   Format:

    -e f    // where f is a floating point number between 0 and 1.

-g / --gategroup

   Format
          A positive integer

   Default value
          100

   Restriction
          can not be negative

   Description

   Use -g to split a simulation containing many time gates into smaller
   but multiple sequential simulations. Format:

    -g n    // n is a positive integer

   Only use this option when the GPU global memory can not hold the data
   for all required time gates, which only happens when one trys to
   simulate a very large domain with very dense time gates (very rare). If
   one's GPU can only hold the data for n time gates, while one has to
   simulate a total of N > n time gates, use -g n to split the total
   simulations into multiple runs: in the first run, MCX will record the
   results for 1~n time gates, in the second run, MCX will launch a new
   kernel to simulate photons for 1~2*n time gates, but only records the
   photon fluence for n+1 ~ 2*n time gates and so on. As one can see, this
   method introduces overhead in the later simulations. Therefore, it is
   recommended to avoid.

-a / --array

   Format
          A boolean, 0 or 1

   Default value
          0

   Restriction
          must be 0 or 1

   Description

   Use -a to tell mcx if the input volume data is a MATLAB-like data
   (column-major) or a C-like data (row-major).Format

    -a 0 (default) // the input volume is a MATLAB-array
    -a 1           // the input volume is a C-array

   If an MATLAB array is used, the fastest loop index is the left-most
   index of an array; while for a C array, it is the right-most index.

GPU options

-L / --listgpu

   Format
          A boolean, 0 or 1

   Default value
          0

   Restriction
          must be 0 or 1

   Description

   Use the -L flag to list all available GPUs on your system without
   running the simulation. For example

-t / --thread

   Format
          An integer

   Default value
          2^14=16384

   Restriction
          can not be negative

   Description

   Use -t to specify the number of threads. Format:

    -t N

   where N is a positive integer. The thread number N must be a multiple
   of 32 - the size of a warp - on all CUDA devices. If N is not a
   multiple of 32, mcx will round it to the nearest multiple less than N.

 To achieve the best efficiency, it is recommended to launch a large number of threads to mazimize the utility of the GPU resources; a thread number larger than 10000 is generally sufficient.

   You should not manually specify the thread number using this option
   when you use the autopilot mode (-A).

-T / --blocksize

   Format
          An integer

   Default value
          64

   Restriction
          can not be negative, must be multiples of 32

   Description

   Use -T to specify the size of a block. Format:

    -T N

   where N is a positive integer. The block size N must be a multiple of
   32 - the size of a warp - on all CUDA devices. If N is not a multiple
   of 32, mcx will round it to the nearest multiple less than N.

 Because mcx does not need inter-thread communication, a small block size, such as 32 or 64, is generally recommended.

   You should not manually specify the block size using this option when
   you use the autopilot mode (-A).

-A / --autopilot

   Format
          A boolean, 0 or 1

   Default value
          1

   Restriction
          must be 0 or 1

   Description

   Use -A to enable automatic thread/block configuration (i.e. autopilot).
   Format:

    -A 1

   When the autopilot mode is enabled, mcx will compute the 'optimal'
   thread number and block size using a heuristic algorithm.

-G / --gpu

   Format
          An integer or a string made of '0's and '1's

   Default value
          1

   Restriction
          If integer, must be positive (>0); if string, can only have '0's
          and '1's.

   Description

   Use -G to specify one or multiple GPUs to run the simulation. Format

    -G 1    // use only the first GPU device (device orders based on 'mcx -L' output)
    -G n    // n is a positive integer, use only the n-th GPU device
    -G 1110 // when -G is followed by a string made of only 0s and 1s, it specifies
            // a mask for active GPUs, for example, 1110 means to use GPU 1-3
            // together while the 4th GPU is not used.

   When multiple GPU devices are specified, one need to use the
   -W/--workload flag to optimally partition the total photons to be
   simulated. By default, photons will be evenly distributed among
   multiple GPU devices.

-W / --workload

   Format
          A list of floating point/integer values, separated by commas

   Default value
          100

   Restriction
          all values must be positive; no space is allowed; length must be
          equal or longer than number of activated GPUs (i.e. count of all
          '1's in -G)

   Description

   Use -W to partition the total simulated photon numbers between multiple
   devices. Format

    -W w1,w2,w3,...  // w_i is a numerical value, corresponding to the relative portions
                     // of the workload of the i-th GPU device. The total load
                     // is proportional to the sum of w_i.

   For example, -W 10,20,20 indicates a 1:2:2 workload split between 3
   active GPUs.If one needs to simulate 1e6 photons, the 1st GPU will run
   2e5 photons, while the 2nd and the 3rd GPUs will run 4e5 photons each.

-I / --printgpu

   Format
          A boolean, 0 or 1

   Default value
          0

   Restriction
          must be 0 or 1

   Description

   The -I option lists all available GPU, same as -L, but it also run the
   actual simulation.

Output options

-s / --session

   Format
          A string

   Default value
          same as the input file name followed by the -f flag (without the
          path); it can not contain <>:"/|?*

   Restriction
          must be 0 or 1

   Description

   Use -s to specify a session ID for the simulation. Format:

    -s session_name // session_name is a string, it can not contain <>:"/|?*

   If -s is set, the output fluence file (.mc2), detected photon file
   (.mch) and the log file (.log) will be named as
   session_name.{mc2,mch,log}. Otherwise, the input file name following
   the -f option will be used in the place of session_name.

-d / --savedet

   Format
          A boolean, 0 or 1

   Default value
          1

   Restriction
          must be 0 or 1

   Description

   Use -d to enable or disable saving the detailed path data for all
   detected photons. Format:

    '-d' or '-d 1' to enable (default) or
    '-d 0' to disable

   When this option is enabled, a binary file, with a suffix of .mch, will
   be produced in additional to the '.mc2' output. The .mch file contains
   the partial path data for all photons enters the aperatures of the
   detectors.

-x / --saveexit

   Format
          A boolean, 0 or 1

   Default value
          0

          A boolean, 0 or 1

   Default value
          0

   Restriction
          must be 0 or 1

   Description

   Use -M to dump the modified volume data for debugging purposes. The
   dumped volume is saved in a binary file with Nx x Ny x Nz bytes, each
   byte contains the tissue label as the input volume, and the highest bit
   of each byte denotes whether the voxel is next to a detector.

-H / --maxdetphoton

   Format
          An integer

   Default value
          1000000

   Restriction
          can not be negative

   Description

   Use -H to specify the maximum number of detected photons. Format:

    -H n    // n is a positive integer, signifying mcx to allocate a buffer to hold n detected photons

   By default, mcx can save up to 1e6 detected photons. If the detected
   photons exceed this limit, mcx will show a warning. Users may use the
   -H option to rerun the simulation and use the number in the warning to
   reallocate the buffer.

-S / --save2pt

   Format
          A boolean, 0 or 1

   Default value
          1

   Restriction
          must be 0 or 1

   Description

   Default value
          0

   Restriction
          must be 0 or 1

   Description

   Use the -l flag to save the MCX's command line output into a log file.
   Format

    '-l' or '-l 1' to enable (default) or
    '-l 0' to disable

   The output file name is 'session_name.log' where 'session_name' is the
   string specified by the -s flag. If -l is used, no message will be
   printed in the command line.

-i / --interactive

   Format
          A boolean, 0 or 1

   Default value
          0

   Restriction
          must be 0 or 1

   Description

   Use -i when one wants to type in the domain settings in an item-by-item
   prompt mode. The -i option can not be used together with -f. When -i is
   used, one can use the redirect operator to include an input file, i.e.

    mcx -i < input.inp
    mcx -f input.inp

   can produce the same answer.

Debug options

2. Input File Format

JSON input file format

   Starting from version 0.7.9, MCX accepts a JSON-formatted input file in
   addition to the conventional tMCimg-like input format. JSON (JavaScript
   Object Notation) is a portable, human-readable and "fat-free" text
   format to represent complex and hierarchical data. Using the JSON
   format makes a input file self-explanatory, extensible and
   easy-to-interface with other applications (like MATLAB).

   A sample JSON input file can be found under the examples/quicktest
   folder. The same file, qtest.json, is also shown below:

 {
    "Help": {
      "[en]": {
        "Domain::VolumeFile": "file full path to the volume description file, can be a binary or JSON file",
        "Domain::Dim": "dimension of the data array stored in the volume file",

        "Domain::Media": "the first medium is always assigned to voxels with a value of 0 or outside of

                         be in 1/mm unit",
        "Session::Photons": "if -n is not specified in the command line, this defines the total photon number",

            {
                "Pos": [29.0,  39.0,  0.0],
                "R": 1.0
            },
            {
                "Pos": [19.0,  29.0,  0.0],
                "R": 1.0
            },
            {
                "Pos": [39.0,  29.0,  0.0],
                "R": 1.0
            }
        ]
    }
 }

   A JSON input file requiers several root objects, namely "Domain",
   "Session", "Forward" and "Optode". Other root sections, like "Help",
   will be ignored. Each object is a data structure providing information
   indicated by its name. Each object can contain various sub-fields. The
   orders of the fields in the same level are flexible. For each field,
   you can always find the equivalent fields in the *.inp input files. For
   example, The "VolumeFile" field under the "Domain" object is the same
   as Line#6 in qtest.inp; the "RNGSeed" under "Session" is the same as
   Line#2; the "Optode.Source.Pos" is the same as the triplet in Line#3;
   the "Forward.T0" is the same as the first number in Line#5, etc.

   An MCX JSON input file must be a valid JSON text file. You can validate
   your input file by running a JSON validator, for example
   [5]http://jsonlint.com/ You should always use "" to quote a "name" and
   separate parallel items by ",".

   MCX accepts an alternative form of JSON input, but using it is not
   recommended. In the alternative format, you can use
 "rootobj_name.field_name": value

   to represent any parameter directly in the root level. For example

 {
    "Domain.VolumeFile": "semi60x60x60.json",
    "Session.Photons": 10000000,
    ...
 }

   You can even mix the alternative format with the standard format. If
   any input parameter has values in both formats in a single input file,
   the standard-formatted value has higher priority.

   To invoke the JSON-formatted input file in your simulations, you can
   use the "-f" command line option with MCX, just like using an .inp
   file. For example:

  mcx -A -n 20 -f onecube.json -s onecubejson

   The input file must have a ".json" suffix in order for MCX to
   recognize. If the input information is set in both command line, and
   input file, the command line value has higher priority (this is the
   same for .inp input files). For example, when using "-n 20", the value
   set in "Session"/"Photons" is overwritten to 20; when using "-s
   onecubejson", the "Session"/"ID" value is modified. If your JSON input
   file is invalid, MCX will quit and point out where the format is
   incorrect.

inp input file format

   Historically, MCX supports an extended version of the input file format
   used by tMCimg. The difference is that MCX allows comments in the input
   file. A typical MCX input file looks like this:

1000000              # total photon, use -n to overwrite in the command line
29012392             # RNG seed, negative to generate
30.0 30.0 0.0 1      # source position (in grid unit), the last num (optional) sets srcfrom0 (-z)
0 0 1                # initial directional vector
0.e+00 1.e-09 1.e-10 # time-gates(s): start, end, step
semi60x60x60.bin     # volume ('unsigned char' binary format)
1 60 1 60            # x voxel size in mm (isotropic only), dim, start/end indices
1 60 1 60            # y voxel size, must be same as x, dim, start/end indices
1 60 1 60            # y voxel size, must be same as x, dim, start/end indices
1                    # num of media
1.010101 0.01 0.005 1.37  # scat. mus (1/mm), g, mua (1/mm), n
4       1.0          # detector number and default radius (in grid unit)
30.0  20.0  0.0  2.0 # detector 1 position (real numbers in grid unit) and individual radius (optional)
30.0  40.0  0.0      # ..., if individual radius is ignored, MCX will use the default radius
20.0  30.0  0.0      #
40.0  30.0  0.0      #
pencil               # source type (optional)
0 0 0 0              # parameters (4 floats) for the selected source
0 0 0 0              # additional source parameters

   Note that the scattering coefficient mus=musp/(1-g).

JSON shape file format

   Starting from v0.7.9, MCX can also use a shape description file in the
   place of the volume file. Using a shape-description file can save you
   from making a binary .bin volume. A shape file uses more descriptive
   syntax and can be easily understood and shared with others.

   Samples on how to use the shape files are included under the
   example/shapetest folder.

   The sample shape file, shapes.json, is shown below:

 {
  "MCX_Shape_Command_Help":{
     "Shapes::Common Rules": "Shapes is an array object. The Tag field sets the voxel value for each
         region; if Tag is missing, use 0. Tag must be smaller than the maximum media number in the
         input file.Most parameters are in floating-point (FP). If a parameter is a coordinate, it
         assumes the origin is defined at the lowest corner of the first voxel, unless user overwrite
         with an Origin object. The default origin of all shapes is initialized by user's --srcfrom0
         setting: if srcfrom0=1, the lowest corner of the 1st voxel is [0,0,0]; otherwise, it is [1,1,1]",
     "Shapes::Name": "Just for documentation purposes, not parsed in MCX",
     "Shapes::Origin": "A floating-point (FP) triplet, set coordinate origin for the subsequent objects",
     "Shapes::Grid": "Recreate the background grid with the given dimension (Size) and fill-value (Tag)",
     "Shapes::Sphere": "A 3D sphere, centered at C0 with radius R, both have FP values",
     "Shapes::Box": "A 3D box, with lower corner O and edge length Size, both have FP values",
     "Shapes::SubGrid": "A sub-section of the grid, integer O- and Size-triplet, inclusive of both ends",
     "Shapes::XLayers/YLayers/ZLayers": "Layered structures, defined by an array of integer triples:
          [start,end,tag]. Ends are inclusive in MATLAB array indices. XLayers are perpendicular to x-axis, and so on",
     "Shapes::XSlabs/YSlabs/ZSlabs": "Slab structures, consisted of a list of FP pairs [start,end]
          both ends are inclusive in MATLAB array indices, all XSlabs are perpendicular to x-axis, and so on",
     "Shapes::Cylinder": "A finite cylinder, defined by the two ends, C0 and C1, along the axis and a radius R",
     "Shapes::UpperSpace": "A semi-space defined by inequality A*x+B*y+C*z>D, Coef is required, but not Equ"
  },
  "Shapes": [
     {"Name":     "Test"},
     {"Origin":   [0,0,0]},
     {"Grid":     {"Tag":1, "Size":[40,60,50]}},
     {"Sphere":   {"Tag":2, "O":[30,30,30],"R":20}},
     {"Box":      {"Tag":0, "O":[10,10,10],"Size":[10,10,10]}},
     {"Subgrid":  {"Tag":1, "O":[13,13,13],"Size":[5,5,5]}},
     {"UpperSpace":{"Tag":3,"Coef":[1,-1,0,0],"Equ":"A*x+B*y+C*z>D"}},
     {"XSlabs":   {"Tag":4, "Bound":[[5,15],[35,40]]}},
     {"Cylinder": {"Tag":2, "C0": [0.0,0.0,0.0], "C1": [15.0,8.0,10.0], "R": 4.0}},
     {"ZLayers":  [[1,10,1],[11,30,2],[31,50,3]]}
  ]
 }

   A shape file must contain a "Shapes" object in the root level. Other
   root-level fields are ignored. The "Shapes" object is a JSON array,
   with each element representing a 3D object or setting. The object-class
   commands include "Grid", "Sphere", "Box" etc. Each of these object
   include a number of sub-fields to specify the parameters of the object.
   For example, the "Sphere" object has 3 subfields, "O", "R" and "Tag".
   Field "O" has a value of 1x3 array, representing the center of the
   sphere; "R" is a scalar for the radius; "Tag" is the voxel values. The
   most useful command is "[XYZ]Layers". It contains a series of integer
   triplets, specifying the starting index, ending index and voxel value
   of a layered structure. If multiple objects are included, the
   subsequent objects always overwrite the overlapping regions covered by
   the previous objects.

   There are a few ways for you to use shape description records in your
   MCX simulations. You can save it to a JSON shape file, and put the file
   name in Line#6 of yoru .inp file, or set as the value for
   Domain.VolumeFile field in a .json input file. In these cases, a shape
   file must have a suffix of .json.

   You can also merge the Shapes section with a .json input file by simply
   appending the Shapes section to the root-level object. You can find an
   example, jsonshape_allinone.json, under examples/shapetest. In this
   case, you no longer need to define the "VolumeFile" field in the input.

   Another way to use Shapes is to specify it using the -P (or --shapes)
   command line flag. For example:

 mcx -f input.json -P '{"Shapes":[{"ZLayers":[[1,10,1],[11,30,2],[31,60,3]]}]}'

   This will first initialize a volume based on the settings in the input
   .json file, and then rasterize new objects to the domain and overwrite
   regions that are overlapping.

   For both JSON-formatted input and shape files, you can use the JSONlab
   toolbox [4] to load and process in MATLAB.
